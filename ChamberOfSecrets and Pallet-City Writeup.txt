Chambers Of Secrets :-

For nmap results check nmap file.For the first flag check Sword.txt and for the rest flags flags.txt .

First Flag:-[Ch4mb3r0fS3cr3ts{Al4rt3_A5c3nd@r3}]

As the ftp server port was open, I went there to enumerate it and I got the passwd.txt file and also one directory named .GodricGryffindor / directory. When I visited .GodricGryffindor directory I got Sword.txt file which is our first flag for the challenge. When I did done further enumeration I got the ```...``` directory and in that directory I got the other passwd.txt file which I guess was a password for the user or something because looking at the nmap results we came to know that the ssh port is also open.

Let's move further for hunting flag2:- [Ch4mb3r0fS3cr3ts{D3v1Ls_5n4R3}]

As we observe from our nmap results we come to know about the samba is running on the machine.I enumerated both the ports 139 and 445 respectively but I didn't find any interesting share using smbclient.But my mind blinked and came to know that we have two passwd.txt files.So I checked both the files wherein in one file there was a leet language string and in the other file there was a base64 string.So I used CyberChef for decoding the base64 string and for other file I used my mind skill for decoding the string and I got this as an output which is as follows:

```Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it's not real?```

```1_4m_Th3_Ch0s3n_0n3``` = ```I_am_The_Chosen_One```

So from the above text,we can get an idea that Harry can be a ssh user.So I tried doing ssh with ```Harry``` as a user and ```1_4m_Th3_Ch0s3n_0n3``` as a password but there was no luck there. But as I was sure that it was a leet language in the passwd.txt file so I tried to visit the leet generator website for generating Harry in the leet language string. So I tried many attempts for and at last I tried to typing this ```h4rry``` as a user and ```1_4m_Th3_Ch0s3n_0n3``` as the password and boom we are logged in the ssh session.But what about the flag?

The main deal is the second flag. So I tried enumerating the file system and in the home directory of the user ```h4rry``` we got one interesting directory called ```GodricHollow```. So I visited that directory and there I found one Seeker.txt file and guess what it is a second flag for the challenge. But what next after getting  flag2 should I have to pwned the machine? Yes,I have pwned the machine and I have to grab the flag3.

So it's time for privilege escalation:-[Ch4mb3r0fS3cr3ts{1_4m_L0rd_V0ld3m0rt}]

So the simple step for privilege escalation is to type ```sudo -l``` to see which binary or file or command is vulnerable to root user. But sadly it didn't work because the h4rry was not in the sudoers list.So what to do next???

We can type ```id``` or else we can check the sudo version as it is now common after the Baron Samedit sudo version exploit. So I checked the sudo version and it was vulnerable and if I typed ```id``` it showed me this as output:-

```uid=1001(h4rry) gid=1001(h4rry) groups=1001(h4rry),130(lxd)```
 
So after observing the output of id command,the user h4rry is included in the lxd group. So we can exploit it by building a alpine image.For the exploitation of root user,refer this website mentioned below:

Pallet-City:-

For nmap results refer pallet_city_nmap file.

Ports Open in the beginning :-21,80
So I visited ftp server first as a anonymous user by referring the nmap results and I got the .ssh file in the file system which is in the ```...```directory as it was a similar practice in the ChamberOfSecrets challenge.In the .ssh file the pokemon name called golisopod was mentioned in the leet language.

First Flag enumeration :- [pallet-city{g0TT@_c@Tch_3m_@Ll}]

I enumerated port 80,and I find the two disallowed entries on the website in the robots.txt file and a key which was unknown where to use. But I enumerated further the disallowed entries which were profslab directory and /profslab/flag file. So I also noticed the cookie value by inspecting the element and guess what it was jwt token. So I copied that cookie value in the website called https://jwt.io and there I come to know that it requires a secret key for verifying the signature and also I noticed the payload ```name``` which has ```User``` as a value. So I used the key which I found earlier as a secret key and I changed the payload value to ```Ash Ketchum``` for the payload ```name``` which can be found on the main(home) page but it won't work so I tried removing spaces between ```Ash Ketchum``` which ultimately looks like ```AshKetchum``` and so I got the new jwt token which is as under:-

```eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiQXNoS2V0Y2h1bSJ9.12ECr1DzjsX9F2urJNnr4SVfoQEMwp23HLU95sZt5dY```

Replacing the cookie value gives us the profslab/flag page as this as an output :-
```
You are here
The flag is : pallet-city{g0TT@_c@Tch_3m_@Ll}
Me, giveup? No Wayyy!
The hint is https://bit.ly/hintshere```

So,finally got our first flag.Let's move further for the remaining flags.

Second Flag:-[pallet_city{YouMightBeAshNowButAreYouWorthyEnoughOfMewtwo?}]

For the second flag,we got one link as a hint and while visiting that link, it was basically a mega file which consist of hints.zip file. So let's download it first and unzip it but it requires password which is not known to us. So there is one tool called fcrackzip which can crack the zip file password by specifying the wordlist. So,I crack the zip file password via fcrackzip tool and the resultant password was ```Charizard-Pokemon``` and boom we got access to two files which are img.jpg and hint.docx.The first file was simply a image file and other one was a docx file but is it really a docx file I suspect because by using file command it showed me pcapng file as an output.So my suspect turns into reality that it is not a docx file but it merely a pcapng file.When I analyse that file,I came to know about the three ports(11701,11702,11703) which are knocked by one single ip(192.168.1.44). So, I used the knocking tool(knock tool) which can knocked the three ports for us. So,I used that tool for knocking and when I tried doing nmap again it showed me ssh port(22) open. So,I tried to ssh with the user ```ashketchum``` and ```g0L150p0D``` as a password and boom I was logged in the ssh session. And I got the second flag from the home directory of the user ```ashketchum```.So after getting the second flag,now it's time for privilege escalation.

Third Flag :- [pallet_city{MeetMewTwoatCeruleanCave}]

I tried ```sudo -l``` but there was no success.
So,I used find command as under:-

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null 

and I got one binary file in the /var/log path.
Path Hijacking vuln :-

Make a new file called cat in the tmp file with this contents as follows:-
chmod +s /bin/bash

And make it executable file.

To hijack the path variable we need to export the tmp directory path as ```export PATH=/tmp:$PATH```. After doing that navigate to /var/log and just execute the binary thereafter and after running the binary type this command ```/bin/bash -p```  to get the root user.

Common things to note in both the machines is ftp server has a anonymous login and also in the file system we have the directory which starts from three dots that's quite rare in the actual file system.Also many were facing issues for submitting flags,but there were this characters ```​​``` in the beginning of the flag characters and at the end of the curly braces.
